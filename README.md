# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start or npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### You can clone, download or fork it if you think it is worth your time investing to it.

In order to clone it just type git clone https://github.com/EmmanuelOkuchukwu/rockstar-social-club-clone.git into the command terminal.

### This is my first clone of an existing website that I have ever done from scratch. 

I chose this website in particular because I'm a huge fan of rockstar games and secondly I love the layout of the website.

### Here are some screenshots of the web application;
